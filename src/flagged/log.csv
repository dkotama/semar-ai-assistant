prove 1+1=2,"The assertion that 1+1=2 is a fundamental result in mathematics. We can use the axiomatic system known as Peano arithmetic, which is a rigorous formulation of the natural numbers. 

Here is a simplified proof using Peano's axioms:

1. **Axiom**: 0 is a natural number.
2. **Axiom**: Every natural number \( n \) has a successor, denoted by \( S(n) \). This successor function is injective, meaning if \( S(n) = S(m) \), then \( n = m \).
3. **Axiom**: 0 is not the successor of any natural number.
4. **Axiom (Induction)**: If a set of numbers contains 0 and is closed under the successor function, then it contains all natural numbers.

Using these axioms, we can define addition:
- Define 1 as \( S(0) \).
- Define the addition operation \( + \) recursively by:
  - \( a + 0 = a \)
  - \( a + S(b) = S(a + b) \)

Now, we prove that \( 1 + 1 = 2 \):

1. Start with the definition of 1: \( 1 \equiv S(0) \).
2. Using the recursive definition of addition: \( 1 + 1 = 1 + S(0) \).
3. Apply the recursive definition of addition to get: \( 1 + S(0) = S(1 + 0) \).
4. Using the base case of addition \( a + 0 = a \): \( 1 + 0 = 1 \).
5. Substitute back into the equation: \( S(1 + 0) = S(1) \).
6. Recognize that 2 is defined as \( S(1) \), hence \( S(1) = 2 \).

Thus, we've shown that \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) within the framework of Peano arithmetic.

The deep rigor of this proof illustrates the foundational structure of arithmetic, as initially formalized by Giuseppe Peano in the late 19th century.
